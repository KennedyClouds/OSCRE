## Documentation for Cables

This document describes how to make the cables for OSCRE. 

## Power Cable
Tools:  diagonal cutting pliers ~$10, wire stripping tool ~$10. Razor blade knife ~$10, smaller philips or flathead screwdriver ~$5.
Supplies: One outdoor rated, 16/3 extension cable of desired length (I use 10').  Note: you may be able to find one with bare leads, but selection is usually limited. 

###### Step 1: 
Use the diagonal cutting pliers to cut off the female plug. This will exposes the three 16AWG cables.  Tip: Do not use the cutting surface of the stripping tool. This is typically too weak
to cleanly cut through the bundle.

###### Step 2: 
Use the razor blade to carefully score the outer sheathing 4-5cm from the end of the cable. Make sure you do not cut into the inner wires! Once the wire is scored, the outer vinyl should slide off with a pull. 
Next, use the 16AWG notch to strip ~1cm of each inner cable.  The inner wire is most likely braided vs. solid copper. Gently twist the copper ends to limit fraying.

###### Step 3: 
Loosen the weatherproof plug on the underside of the housing and insert the cable. Make sure the threaded piece is still on the cable so you can secure it later.

###### Step 4: 
Use the screwdriver to loosen the connections on the power supply. Match colors (green = ground, black = hot, white = neutral), insert, then tighten the screws to secure. 
You should not see exposed copper wire. Once secure, make sure there is adequate slack (see picture), then tighten the fitting to secure the cable.
