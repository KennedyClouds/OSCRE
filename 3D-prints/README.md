## Documentation for 3D Printing OSCRE components

Within this directory you will find files that will allow you to print the lens and computer mounts. Files are provided in both [openSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) and \ STL formats. These should place nice with any slicer of your choosing. 


## Overview of parts

The lensholder is designed to fit 5mm hardware. The bottom plate is first bolted to the metal plate of the Dotworkz platform. The lens and adapter is then attached to the camera and the 5mm extension tube. This is then set into the bottom plate and secured by bolting the top plate and adding the clip over the camera. Note that Dotworkz platforms sometimes have different length build plates depending on the model purchased. Exact positions may vary slightly and washers my be needed to securerly fasten to the metal plate. The front of the lens should be ~1.5cm distant from the front of the housing.

The computer should first be attached to the mount. An additional clip is provided for additional security. The platform is secured with #8 screws to the predrilled holes in the DotWorkz housing.  

## Tips and Tricks for Printing

* Prints have been made on Creality Ender3 and Prusa MK3+ printers. PETG or PLA can be used (I prefer PETG).
* Make sure to use build supports. These can be carefully broken away or trimmed off after printing.
